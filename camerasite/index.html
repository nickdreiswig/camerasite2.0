        <h2>How a Camera Operates</h2>
      </div>
      <p class="works-info">A camera lens takes all the light rays bouncing around and uses glass to
        redirect them to a single point, creating a sharp image. When all of those
        light rays meet back together on a
        digital camera sensor or a piece of film, they create a sharp image.</p>
        <img class="diagram" src="img/diagram.png" alt="">
        <div class="reversetitle">
          <h3>Why is it Reversed?</h3>
          <p class="reverse-info">When light rays are forced through a small opening, they cross.
                                When we see, the image is recorded on our retinas upside down
                                as well — it’s up to our brain to flip it.</p>

          <h3>Aperture ( f )</h3>
        </div>

        <p class="aperture-info">Light enters into the “dark chamber” through a small opening. We call
          the size of this opening the aperture.
          Apertures are measured in f-stops, with smaller numbers
          meaning the opening is wider. Similar to an iris, when a room is dark an iris expands and when the room is bright the iris constricts.
        </p>
      </div>


      <div class="shutter">
        <h3>Shutter Speed</h3>
        <p class="shutter-info">The longer the film or sensor is exposed, the more light will be
          in the final image. If there’s not enough time, the image will be
          underexposed, if there’s too much time, the image will be
          overexposed.
        </p>

      </div>

      <div class="iso">
        <h3>ISO</h3>
        <p class="iso-info">is the measurement of how sensitive the film or sensor is. Lower numbers are less sensitive, higher numbers are more
          sensitive. The lower the number, the more light you need to achieve a good exposure and vise versa. </p>

    <div class="meter">
      <h3>Light Meter</h3>
      <p class="shutter-info">
      Your camera will have an exposure meter that tells you if your image will come out underexposed, exposed well, or over exposed. Use this meter to determine
      if your settings need to be changed.  </p>
   </div>

      <div class="histo">
        <h3>Histogram</h3>
        <p class="histo-info">Some digital cameras will show a histogram — a small graph
  that shows you where the pixels in the frame fall on a scale of
  dark to light.</p>

        </div>





      <div class="expo">
        <h3>Exposure Compensation</h3>
        <p class="iso-info">
          Sometimes you may want to override your camera’s opinion to
          get a better balance of light and dark in the image. For example, maybe the sky
          in the background is too bright and the flower you're adjusting for is correctly exposed
           on the meter. You would adjust the settings to under-expose the flower and worry about
           brightening the flower in post processing.   </p>
